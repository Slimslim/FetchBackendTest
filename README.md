# üßæ Receipt Processor API

This is a **Receipt Processing Web Service** that assigns points based on receipt details.

## üöÄ Features

-   Accepts receipt submissions via a `POST /receipts/process` endpoint.
-   Retrieves receipt points using `GET /receipts/{id}/points`.
-   In-memory storage (no database required).
-   Implements various point calculation rules.

## üî¢ How Points Are Calculated

| Rule                                                                | Points Awarded |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1 point per alphanumeric character in the retailer name             | ‚úÖ             |
| 50 points if `total` is a round dollar amount                       | ‚úÖ             |
| 25 points if `total` is a multiple of `0.25`                        | ‚úÖ             |
| 5 points for every two items                                        | ‚úÖ             |
| Item description length is a multiple of 3 ‚Üí `(price * 0.2)` points | ‚úÖ             |
| 6 points if the purchase date is **odd**                            | ‚úÖ             |
| 10 points if purchase time is **between 2:00PM - 4:00PM**           | ‚úÖ             |

## üõ† Debugging Routes

For testing purposes, I included additional API routes:

| Method | Route            | Description                              |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/receipts/`     | Fetch all receipts stored in memory      |
| `GET`  | `/receipts/{id}` | Fetch full details of a specific receipt |

These are **not required** by the exercise but can help debug the system. You can ignore or remove them if not needed.
